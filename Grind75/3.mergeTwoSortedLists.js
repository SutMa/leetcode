/**LINKED LIST
 * 
 * Instruction:
 * You are given two sorted linked lists. 
 * The task is to merge these two sorted linked lists into a single, sorted linked list. 
 * The final sorted linked list should not be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists 
 * but by creating new nodes.
 * 
 * Example:
 * list1 = 1 -> 2 -> 4
 * list2 = 1 -> 3 -> 4
 * 
 * 1 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 4
 */

/**
 * Solution Explained:
 * We want to use the Linked Lists to combine the lists to produce a new return.
