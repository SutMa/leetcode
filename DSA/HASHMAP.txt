HASHMAPS:
Storage of key-value pairs.
Provides fast access to values based on their keys, used to optimize lookup operations. 

// This is our hashmap (school system)
var students = {
    "ID123": "John's Notebook",
    "ID124": "Sara's Notebook",
    "ID125": "Alex's Notebook"
};

// To get John's notebook using his ID:
console.log(students["ID123"]);  // Outputs: "John's Notebook"
